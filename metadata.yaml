summary: '"Flashlights" by Mary Aldis is a collection of poems, stories, and sketches
  written in the early 20th century. This book captures various moments of human emotion
  and experience, reflecting themes of longing, love, and societal observation. Through
  its blend of poetic forms and narrative prose, it delves into the complexities of
  life, love, and the search for meaning in a rapidly changing world.  The content
  of "Flashlights" flows through a series of vignettes and lyrical pieces, exploring
  the lives of everyday charactersâ€”from the troubled souls in a barber shop to the
  poignant exchanges among strangers on a park bench. Each section portrays different
  facets of life, capturing moments of connection, reflection, and the struggles that
  people face amid the backdrop of city life. Aldis''s writing emphasizes the subtleties
  of human interaction and the emotions that lie beneath the surface, ultimately inviting
  readers to pause and consider their own experiences in the tapestry of life. (This
